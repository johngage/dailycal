<p>Jupyter Books combine Jupyter Notebooks with online publishing machinery to let you build an online data-analytic newspaper using a collection of Jupyter Notebooks
and Markdown files, while adding extra functionality for Jupyter data analysis.</p>
<p>These powerful innovations were created at the University of California, Berkeley, and are transforming scientific research, data analysis, pedagogy and publishing.</p>
<h2 id="New-Intellectual-Technology">New Intellectual Technology<a class="anchor-link" href="#New-Intellectual-Technology"> </a></h2><p>The core innovation in intellectual technology that has lead to the explosion of data science and its companion disciplines of machine learning, causal inference, and prediction is a powerful integration of text and computation called <strong>Jupyter Notebooks</strong>. The name is derived from the names of two interactive programming languages, Julia and Python, and their integration with text, diagrams, and visualizations.</p>
<p>Jupyter Notebooks were created by Fernando Pérez, UCB Statistics and Berkeley Institite of Data Science.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sla_vxu-jDk">In a 2019 TED video</a>, Pérez describes Jupyter Notebooks; in this second video, he explains the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_lDvcFMimw&amp;t=16s">origins of repeatable data analysis</a>, using a Berkeley-developed geophysics example, Pangeo.  And here is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/[]">the Atlantic's take on the future of scientific writing</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Data-Science">Data Science<a class="anchor-link" href="#Data-Science"> </a></h2><p>The famous Berkeley course, <a href="">Data Science 8</a> was created three years ago in a remarkable collaboration among several Berkeley departments, including Computer Science, Statistics, Public Policy, Physics, Astronomy, City Planning, and others.</p>
<p>This week, the new <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2018/11/29/berkeley-setting-up-division-to-build-on-data-sciences-momentum.aspx">Data Science Division</a> found its <a href="https://bsa.berkeley.edu/news/announcement-associate-provost-division-data-science-and-information-and-dean-school">new permanent Dean, Jennifer Chayes</a> who also assumes the new Associate Provost for the Division of Data Science position:</p>
<p>In Spring, 2019, over two thousand students took Data Science 8, and over one thousand took the sequential course, Data Science 100. EdX had over 50,000 students take the course, world-wide.</p>
<p>If you want a <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/foundations-of-data-science-computational-thinking-with-python-0">quick, free introduction</a>,
