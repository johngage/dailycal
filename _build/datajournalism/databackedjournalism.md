# Reforming journalism for 2020 to incorporate data analyis

In 2017, the New York Times formed a 7-reporter group--**The 2020 Group**--to outline the future of the NYT newsroom.

|[_Journalism That Stands Apart_](https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2020-report/index.html) | David Leonhardt, Jodi Rudoren, Jon Galinsky, Karron Skog, Marc Lacey, Tom Giratikanon and Tyson Evans |

The 2020 Group focuses on new tools available, or that should be available, to reporters. They discuss graphics, visualizations and interactives, but, in 2017, they were not aware of the computational and analytic tools built into Jupyter Notebooks and Jupyter Books.

Today, Jupyter Notebooks constantly extend the platform with new, powerful tools: causality diagrams, inference graphs, course material from over one hundred departments.

The Daily Cal can work with the Berkeley creators of Jupyter Notebooks to extend the vision of the 2020 Group at the New York Times to today's network environment.

Berkeley could pioneer in developing the tools of computational reporting.


## All numerically-based assertions in any story should be accompanied by a Jupyter notebook containing:
- all data source references
- the accompanying data analysis
- visualizations

## Possible Initiative to Work With Global High School Journalism Classes and Publications
The Daily Cal can link to Berkeley High School, Richmond High School, Oakland Tech, Kennedy High, and other local high school journalism organizations to develop Jupyter Book materials and workshops in the area of data journalism.

High school journalism and newpapers generate tens of thousands of potential future journalists. As data science enters the high school curriculum, the Daily Cal can help form the environment to build computational journalism.
