# The Daily Californian and data-backed stories

## Can the [**Daily Cal**](https://www.dailycal.org/) develop and extend new forms of journalism built on open data, open analysis, and open sources?

Can every story containing numerical data, maps, or statistics published by the Daily Cal be accompanied by an online Jupyter notebook with open access to all supporting data?

Look at some stories from the past few weeks. 1

Jupyter Books combine Jupyter Notebooks with online publishing machinery to let you build an online data-analytic newspaper using a collection of Jupyter Notebooks
and Markdown files, while adding extra functionality for Jupyter data analysis.

These powerful innovations were created at the University of California, Berkeley, and are transforming scientific research, data analysis, pedagogy and publishing.

The core innovation in intellectual technology that has lead to the explosion of data science and its companion disciplines of machine learning, causal inference, and prediction is a powerful integration of text and computation called Jupyter Notebooks. The name is derived from the names of two interactive programming languages, Julia and Python, and their integration with text, diagrams, and visualizations.

Jupyter Notebooks were created by Fernando Pérez, UCB Statistics and Berkeley Institite of Data Science.
Here is a 2019 video of Pérez explaining the origins of repeatable data analysis, using a Berkeley-developed geophysics example, Pangeo.

The famous Berkeley course, [Data Science 8]() was created three years ago in a remarkable collaboration among several Berkeley departments, including Computer Science, Statistics, Public Policy, Physics, Astronomy, City Planning, and others.

This week, the new [Data Science Division](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2018/11/29/berkeley-setting-up-division-to-build-on-data-sciences-momentum.aspx) found its [new permanent Dean, Jennifer Chayes](https://bsa.berkeley.edu/news/announcement-associate-provost-division-data-science-and-information-and-dean-school) who also assumes the new Associate Provost for the Division of Data Science position:

In Spring, 2019, over two thousand students took Data Science 8, and over one thousand took the sequential course, Data Science 100.

For an example of a book built with Jupyter Books, see the [textbook for Data 100](https://www.textbook.ds100.org/) at UC Berkeley.

Here are a few features of Jupyter Books

* All course content is written in markdown and Jupyter Notebooks, stored in `notebooks/`
* The Jupyter Book repo comes packaged with helper scripts to convert these into Jekyll pages (in `scripts/`) that can be hosted for free on GitHub
* Pages can have [Binder](https://mybinder.org) or JupyterHub links automatically added for interactivity.
* The website itself is based on Jekyll, and is highly extensible and can be freely-hosted on GitHub.
* There are lots of nifty HTML features under-the-hood, such as Turbolinks fast-navigation and
  click-to-copy in code cells.

## Getting started

To get started, you may be interested in the following links.
Here are a few links of interest:

* **[Quickstart](features/features)** is a quick demo and overview of Jupyter Books.

* **[The Jupyter Book Guide](guide/01_overview)**
  will step you through the process of configuring and building your own Jupyter Book.

* **[The Jupyter Book template repo](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book)** is the template
  repository you'll use as a start for your Jupyter Book.

* **A demo of the Jupyter Book** can be browsed via the sidebar to the left.

## Installation

Here's a brief rundown of how to create your own Jupyter Book using this site. For a more
complete guide, see [the Jupyter Book guide](guide/01_overview).

* Fork the Jupyter Book template repo
* Replace the demo notebooks in `content/` with your own notebooks and markdown files.
* Create a Table of Contents yaml file by editing `_data/toc.yaml`.
* Generate the Jekyll markdown for your notebooks by running `scripts/generate_book.py`
* Push your changes to GitHub (or wherever you host your site)!
